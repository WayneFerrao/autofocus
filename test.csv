Its straight piped 3in exhaust, its cammed, boost control, upgraded intercooler and radiator.  Current issues:  Stripped out headliner and trunk (as shown in pictures)  Will need a clutch, pedals are starting to get stiff. Sunroof won't open Has a dent on the right quarter panel (shown on pictures)  Car could use a paint job. Car has not given me any issues for 2 years, perfect project car for anyone who has the time.  $12,500.00  Email me for more questions or also text me for more info or questions.
